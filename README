MEDRank is a ranking system meant to work on biomedical data, mostly UMLS 
concepts. It also has facilities for performing basic IR evaluation, and one 
semantically-aware vector cosine comparison (see MEDRank/evaluation).

Requires Python 2.6 or 2.7 and BioPython (www.biopython.org) 

Documentation will be forthcoming. MEDRank is meant to be a library you use to
build your own rankers and evaluators. Sample code will be provided eventually. 
In the meantime, please contact me if you need assistance.

If you want to experiment with the biomedical literature you'll need to get a
