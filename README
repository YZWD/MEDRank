MEDRank v0.6.1

Â© 2010 Jorge.R.Herskovic@uth.tmc.edu

Released under the GPL v2 (see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html or the GPL-2.0.txt file included in this distribution).

MEDRank is a ranking system meant to work on biomedical data, mostly UMLS 
concepts. It also has facilities for performing basic IR evaluation, and one 
semantically-aware vector cosine comparison (see MEDRank/evaluation).

Requires Python 2.6 or 2.7 and BioPython (www.biopython.org) 

Documentation will be forthcoming. MEDRank is meant to be a library you use to
build your own rankers and evaluators. There is one example available in the
examples/ directory that implements summarization as described by Mihalcea in 
2004 (Mihalcea and Tarau. TextRank: Bringing Order into Texts. Proceedings of
the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2004))
using MEDRank. I also provide one of my own blog posts in a suitable format to
test the code with (examples/blog_post.txt)

More sample code will be provided eventually. In the meantime, please contact me
if you need assistance.

If you want to experiment with the biomedical literature you'll need to get a 
copy of the MeSH trees (all files in the ASCII format) from 
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/filelist.html 

CHANGELOG
v0.6.1
    - Fixed a bug in link hashing and adirectional link hashing
    - Logging improvements in default workflows
    
v0.6.0
    - Bug fixes galore
    - Multithreaded locking for SQLite Dictionaries
    - Separate concept and PubMed article server processes (requires web.py from http://webpy.org)

RELEASE NOTES
    Before starting a process that attempts to use the PubMed article cache or the Concept cache, you must start them individually. The scripts are in MEDRank/pubmed/pmid_cache.py and MEDRank/umls/concept_cache.py. They still have some rough edges.
