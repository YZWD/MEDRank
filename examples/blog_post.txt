Sharing data with other institutions is a problem.
HIPAA makes it difficult and cumbersome, and some patients fear for their privacy.
Giving data to students is also encumbered for the same reasons. 
And, frankly, much of it is due to fear: what if a students stores it on his/her laptop, unencrypted, and then loses it?
There is no simple answer to these questions. 
We take great care in protecting patient data.
We spend money, time, and lots of elbow grease making sure it stays where it’s supposed to.
Yet our students must learn, and we must do research.
Enter the Data Fakehouse.
This is a simple set of scripts that creates a simulated data warehouse. 
It has a lot of simplifying assumptions, but it’s good enough for some kinds of research (specially into data mining techniques) and for teaching purposes. 
Here are some of the more relevant simplifying assumptions:
All diseases are chronic.
Care is episodic. 
In other words, this is an encounter-based setting, like an outpatient clinic.
Patients have a condition from the start, or they don’t.
Conditions don’t appear during the course of care.
There’s a standard set of labs that is ordered every single time a patient with a condition visits. 
You can think of vitals as ‘labs’ if that helps.
The number of potential conditions is small. 
This can be increased easily, if necessary.
All lab values are normally distributed, both the normal and abnormal ones.
We know the ground truth about whether a patient has a condition or not (great for computing sensitivity and specificity!)
To run it, you’ll need PostgreSQL. 
I only tested it on the 8.3 series, but pretty much any version greater than 8.0 should work. 
You’ll also need Python 2.x (2.5 or greater should do the trick) and psycopg2.
You will need to edit the create_db.sh script to fit your system, but with a minimal amount of UNIX experience it will be straightforward.
